# Syringe Pump Control

The software was created to manage and control [new era syringe pumps](http://www.syringepump.com/) connected to gut culture device developed in [Yissachar Lab](https://www.yissacharlab.com/). 

Pumps are connected through RS232 and can be modified simultaneously by COM port.

The software allow to control the following:
- syringe diameter
- pumping direction
- pumping rate
- pumping rate units
- volume to be pumped. 

The software also allows the calculations of the volume to be pumped by desired time and rate and the find syringe diameter by manufacturer and syringe volume.
